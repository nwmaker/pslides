# Design Flow

![](/images/flow.png)

---

# Design Steps

1. Run "create boardname width height"

2. Run "build boardname"

3. modify generated SVG, run "update boardname"

4. modify text file, run "build boardname"

5. repeat step 3 or step 4 

6. run "gerber boardname" to generate Gerber files

---

# Create Board

```jsx
(autopcb-env) demo $./create hello 30 40
start to create the board ...
  boardname: hello
  width: 30
  length: 40
start to generate the template for AutoPCB...
the template is completed successfully.
start to generate vias for AutoPCB...
addvias completed successfully.
hello is created successfully
```
//<VimeoPlayer videoId="291401262" />

---

# Build SVG for the Board

```jsx
(autopcb-env) demo $./build hello
start to create svg for the board ...
  boardname: hello
-- Processing AutoPCB's configuration file
-- Processing board's configuration file
-- Creating board
 * Placing components:
 * Placing routes
 * Placing vias
 * Placing shapes

# Change Outline of the Board

---

## default outline in hello.json

```jsx
    "shape": {
      "height": 40.0,
      "style": "stroke",
      "type": "rect",
      "width": 30.0
    }
```

---

## new outline in hello.json

```jsx
    "shape": {
      "height": 45.0,
      "style": "stroke",
      "type": "path",
      "value": "m -37.771994,-19.984607 c 0.04322,-0.512431...",
      "width": 45.0
    }
```

## initial shapes empty in hello.json

```jsx
"shapes": {

```

---

## add all graphics

```jsx
  "NW": {
      "footprint": "nwlogo", 
      "layer": "top", 
      "location": [
        15.241101,

# PCB House

* There are many PCB manufacturer around world.

* AutoPCB is trying to find partners for easy order with options.

# Arrival of boards

# AutoPCB: draw the circuits, get the board

** Feasible **

---

# Future Plan

* run the transforms between text, SVG, and gerber

* integrate an SVG editor for line drawing

* integrate a text editor for configuration and path data

* user signup and login

* API: New, Open, Save, Build, Update, Gerber, Upload, Order, etc.

# AutoPCB: draw the circuits, get the board

** Let's do it **

# Thank you!
